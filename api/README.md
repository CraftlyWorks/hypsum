# Hypsum API

This module is what you need to create your own placeholders or use them in your code.

## Key Parts

- `HypsumApi`: Use this to register your placeholders or replace them in text.
- `HypsumProvider`: How you get access to the API.
- `Placeholder`: What you implement to make a new placeholder.

If you are a developer, this is the only module you need to add to your project.
